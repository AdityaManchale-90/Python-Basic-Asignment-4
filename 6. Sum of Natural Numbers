# 6. Write a Python Program to Find the Sum of Natural Numbers?

# This program returns the sum of natural numbers for the nth term

# Take input from user for the nth term

def naturalsum():
    n = int(input("Enter the nth term: "))

    if n < 0:
        print("Enter a positive number")
    else:
        # initialize sum
        sum = 0
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            sum = sum+i
        print(sum)

naturalsum()
